            <h1>Modern Art</h1>
                    <p>Modern art is a style of art that arose in the late nineteenth 
                and early twentieth centuries. It was distinguished by a departure from established 
                styles in favor of a more abstract, experimental approach to making works of art. 
                Impressionism, Expressionism, Cubism, Fauvism, Dadaism, and Surrealism are examples of 
                major modern art trends. Pablo Picasso, Wassily Kandinsky, Salvador Dal, and Marcel Duchamp 
                were all influential modernist artists. Modern art has had a long-lasting influence on the e
                volution of visual culture and continues to do so now.
                <br><br><br>
                    Some of the artwork created during this time period was in more traditional or 
                classical styles. However, the word "modern art" is connected with art that defied previous 
                conventions and approaches.

                    <h2>Vir Heroicus Sublimis, 1950 - 1951</h2>
                    <p>Vir Heroicus Sublimis means "man, heroic, and sublime" in Latin. With 
                    this information, the picture takes on an altogether new meaning.Vir Heroicus 
                    Sublimis is a testimonial to the human condition - tragedy is overpowering, and 
                    humanity is only a small piece, "zip", amongst the enormous empathy and devastation
                    of the human experience. In this way, Vir Heroicus Sublimis represents some viewers' 
                    initial awareness of something important while explaining their own life experiences. 
                    It is universal - everyone has felt at some point in their lives that they are nothing 
                    more than a zip code, and Newman has produced a truly universal painting experience.

                    <h2>Poker Game (1894) </h2>
                    <p>The painter effectively demonstrated the end of segregation and that
                    all people have the same basic rights by utilizing diverse types of dogs. Also 
                    visible is the grey dog showing the brown dog its cards. Because it is not permitted
                    to expose one's playing cards during the game, this reveals a plan to cheat and steal
                    from the others. While the grey dog is busy displaying his cards to the brown dog in 
                    the back, he is watching to see if the other dogs notice his antics.</p>

                    <h2>The Cracked Cardinal (2001, Artificial Realism) </h2>
                    <p>The medium for this picture is an oil-based painting that, in detail, resembles
                    Pablo Picasso's cubism style with the abstract elements on the face. Condo characterizes
                    his self-proclaimed style as "Psychological Cubism," which is defined as horrific aspects
                    of the human face and displaying hideous, defective features of what is behind a regular human
                    face we see every day. </p>

                    <h2> Les Demoiselles dâ€™Avignon (Cubism) </h2>
                    <p>Pablo Picasso's paintings, probably the most famous of the twentieth century, 
                    have received global recognition. Les Demoiselles d'Avignon, also known as The Brothel
                    of Avignon, is one of the most iconic paintings in the cubism style and one of the most 
                    recognizable paintings in the world. The piece includes five sharply angled portraits of 
                    women, each of whose visage appears eerily familiar to those who have seen African art before 
                    them. The composition of the artwork is well balanced, with a high degree of contrast between 
                    the vibrant red and blue tones on either side of the canvas.

                    <h2> Impression, Sunrise (Impressionism)</h2>
                    <p>credited with coining the word "Impressionism."
                        Monet made six separate paintings of his hometown's harbor in Le Havre, 
                    France. The most well-known of the series is Impression Sunrise, which was presented 
                    alongside works by other painters in 1874, when this new kind of painting garnered a 
                    lot of criticism.
                <br>
                        Completed in 1872, this painting depicts a seascape scene from Le Havre, France, 
                    where Monet is said to have spent a significant amount of time throughout his life. The 
                    painting is notable for its delicate, but seductive hues, which depict a peaceful daybreak 
                    over the busy port city at the time Monet painted it. The larger ships and barges are hardly 
                    visible as they disappear into the early morning mist.

                    <h2>Drowning Girl (American Pop)</h2>
                    <p>American pop artist Roy Lichtenstein created one of the most unforgettable paintings 
                    of the 1960s with his famous Drowning Girl. This piece was inspired by Secret Love #83, a classic 
                    DC Comics book that depicted a dramatic scene in which the heroine drowns recklessly in front of 
                    her boyfriend. Lichtenstein portrayed his joy in this painting by focusing on the profoundly evocative 
                    but distant landscape of grief. The girl's precarious situation is emphasized by swirling water enveloping 
                    her head as she falls beneath the waves.</p>

                    <h2>Olympia</h2>
                    <p>The painting depicts a young lady standing in the same iconic pose as some of history's 
                    most famous naked works of art, yet her eyes and facial expression are radically different. Instead of 
                    a friendly appearance, she emits boredom as she returns her attention to the next guy who will buy her 
                    company for a short while.

                        This work of art has been praised by critics and art enthusiasts alike for offering a fresh
                    and honest look at something that is typically considered taboo in many parts of Western culture.</p>

                    <h2>Nympheas</h2>
                    <p>The panels' brilliant richness of color and light draws the viewer's attention to
                the immense diversity of nature as well as the depth and mystery of the life it sustains. The fascinating 
                thing about these works is that most of them were painted while Monet's eyesight was declining due to cataract. 
                Claude Monet's water-lily paintings are among the most well-known and famous works of 20th-century art, and have 
                had a significant impact on subsequent generations of painters.</p>
