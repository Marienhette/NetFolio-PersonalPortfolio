            <h1>Ancient Greece</h1>
                    <p>Ancient Greece was a northeastern Mediterranean civilization,
                 existing from the Greek Dark Ages of the 12th to 9th centuries BC to the end of classical antiquity,
                that comprised a loose collection of culturally and linguistically related city-states and other territories.
                <br><br><br>
                The historical period of ancient Greece is unique in world history as the first period attested directly in comprehensive,
                 narrative historiography, while earlier ancient history or protohistory is known from much more fragmentary documents such as annals, king lists, and pragmatic epigraphy.

                    <h2>The Hellenistic Art</h2>
                    <p>Hellenistic art is the art of the Hellenistic period generally taken to begin with the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BCE and end with the conquest of the Greek world by the Romans,
                     a process well underway by 146 BCE, when the Greek mainland was taken, and essentially ending in 30 BCE with the conquest of Ptolemaic Egypt following the Battle of Actium. A number of the
                     best-known works of Greek sculpture belong to this period, including Laoco√∂n and His Sons, Venus de Milo, and the Winged Victory of Samothrace. It follows the period of Classical Greek art,
                     while the succeeding Greco-Roman art was very largely a continuation of Hellenistic trends.</p>

                    <h2>Blue Monkey Fresco</h2>
                    <p>Painting did not only occur on flat surfaces and empty vessels; it was also a decorative act for sculptures. 
                     Many stone sculptures were also painted in vivid colors on different parts of statues, usually to highlight the hair, clothing, or specific body parts.
                     Classical Greek art saw the emergence of pictorial forms in painting along with the tempera and encaustic painting techniques.</p>

                    <h2>Painted Limestone Funerary Stele</h2>
                    <p>Painted during the Hellenistic period in ancient Greece, this limestone stele depicts a man with ochre-colored skin and a pale-yellow garment seated in the middle on a raised stool.
                     It is believed that the man is in the position of a farewell gesture with his hands joined to a tall woman wearing a pale chiton and himation.The balanced and calm nature of the composition
                     originated from grave relief artwork of the 4th century BC. This stele was originally found lying against the wall of an underground tomb but its structure suggests that it was intended for lodging in a base above the ground.</p>

                    <p>This Terracotta Loutrophoros is an example of Late Classical Greek art and was a vessel used in ancient Greek ceremonies to carry water. 
                     The artist credited for this vase painting is a Metope painter, whose details remain unknown.The podium contains triglyphs that alternate with metopes that showcase Greeks
                     fighting the Amazons. A small naiskoi (temple) is seen enclosing a woman, yet the mystery remains concerning the representation of funerary structures and limestone reliefs.</p>

                    <h2>Terracotta Pyxis</h2>
                    <p>This famous Greek painting on a 5th-century vase portrays the traditional scene of the judgment of Paris. The judgment of Paris is a narrative from Greek mythology that revolves around the events 
                     that led up to the Trojan War and the founding of Rome. The story describes the account of Eris, the Goddess of discord who was not invited to Peleus and Thetis wedding and sought revenge for her exclusion.
                     The three goddesses, Aphrodite, Hera, and Athena selected Paris of Troy to choose the fairest deity. Paris ended up choosing Aphrodite through a bribe and agreement to give Helen of Sparta to him, who was the most
                     beautiful woman in the world and the wife of Menelaus. This was to be the cause of the Trojan War since Paris took Helen to Troy, resulting in the invasion of Troy by the Greeks.</p>

                    <h2>Nekyia</h2>
                    <p>The turn of the Archaic Greek period around 500 BC saw the emergence of the human body in sculpture and painting. This was seen as the first major move toward illusionism and was practiced by one of 
                      the greatest Greek masters,Polygnotus of Thasos. While there are no remains of his original work, Carl Robert published reconstructions of Polygnotus best works, one of which can be seen above as Neykia.
                      It is believed that Polygnotus produced most of his work from around 480 BC and employed a simple color palette of black, white, red, and ochre.</p>

                    <h2>The Kachrylion Kylix</h2>
                    <p>This Kylix (drinking cup) is one of the remaining artifacts from ancient Greece that marks the height of trade and development in Athens and the export boom with Italy. 
                     This famous Greek painting on the cup was most likely created by Oltos or Euphronios, who worked with the potter of this cup, Kachrylion. The painted image on the cup portrays Eros holding a lotus tendril mid-flight.
                     The cup first saw the light of day in 1882 at a cemetery in Orvieto.According to the traditional story, Eros flies over the sea, which refers to the birth of his mother Aphrodite from the ocean. Recent narratives place Eros 
                     between the sky and earth as an intermediary between the mortal and divine worlds. The outer layer of the cup portrays a cyclical depiction of the acts performed by Theseus (hero and founder of Athens) on his journey to Athens from Troizen. </p>

                    <h2>The Euphoronios Krater</h2>
                    <p>The Euphronios Krater also referred to as the Sarpedon Krater, is a calyx-krater pot from ancient Greece used to mix wine and water. The bowl was created around 515 BC 
                     and is known to be one of the last 27 surviving painted vases crafted by one of the most popular Greek painters, Euphronios. The Euphronios Krater was initially part of an illegal excavation near Cerveteri,
                     which later made its way to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. The vase was repatriated in 2008 to Italy and is currently housed at the Archaeological Museum of Cerveteri.</p>
