            <h1>Renaissance period</h1>
                    <p>The period immediately following the Middle Ages in Europe,
                known as the Renaissance, saw a significant rebirth of interest in the 
                classical learning and values of ancient Greece and Rome. The emergence 
                of new technologies--including the printing press, a new system of 
                astronomy,and the discovery and exploration of new continents--was
                accompanied by a blossoming of philosophy,literature, and notably art--against
                 a backdrop of political  stability and expanding affluence.
                <br><br><br>
                    The Renaissance style of painting, sculpture, and
                decorative arts first appeared in Italy
                in the late 14th century, and it reached its pinnacle in the
                late 15th and early 16th centuries, in
                the work of Italian masters such as Leonardo da Vinci,
                Michelangelo, and Raphael. In addition to
                expressing traditional Greco-Roman traditions, Renaissance
                painting aspired to portray the individual's
                experience as well as the beauty and mystery of nature.

                    <h2>The last Supper</h2>
                    <p>The Last Supper is often seen as a foreshadowing of Jesus'
                        sacrifice on the cross.
                        During the meal, when Jesus broke bread and shared wine with
                        His disciples, these words are understood to
                        be a prediction of Jesus' upcoming death and his sacrifice on
                        the cross for the salvation of humanity.</p>

                    <h2>Madonna in the Meadow</h2>
                    <p>The painting of the Madonna in the Meadow (also called the
                        Madonna Belvedere) was executed by a twenty-something Raphael while in
                        Florence.
                        The scene shows the Virgin with Christ and St. John the
                        Baptist in a highly serene and tender moment against a landscape backdrop
                        which places the scene in a Tuscan setting.
                        In addition to being the cousin of Christ, St. John the
                        Baptist was the patron of Florence, making his presence here in a
                        Florentine setting very appropriate.</p>

                    <h2>The Abduction of Ganymede</h2>
                    <p>The child (Ganymede) is being taken away by an Eagle
                        (Zeus), however the child's face shows no dismay. The flowing lavender
                        robes and the splayed legs of the child almost give an adventurous tone to
                        this painting.
                        The dog in the lower right corner looks up in admiration of
                        this act, while the eagle looks down with scorn. The artist of this
                        painting Antonio Allegri da Correggio, usually known as Correggio, was the
                        foremost painter
                        of the Parma school of the Italian Renaissance, who was
                        responsible for some of the most vigorous and sensuous works of the 16th
                        century.</p>

                    <h2>The Holy Family </h2>

                        1530 oil on panel painting by Bernardino Luini. It was previously in the
                        collection of Cardinal Federico Borromeo,
                        who recorded his acquisition of it in his writings and
                        gave it to the new Biblioteca Ambrosiana in Milan in 1618, where it still
                        hangs. The work was seized in 1796 by occupying French troops and taken to
                        Paris,
                        where it hung in the Louvre until being returned to Milan
                        in 1815.</p>

                    <h2>The Feast of Venus</h2>
                    <p>The Feast of Venus is an oil on canvas painting by Flemish
                        painter Peter Paul Rubens, created in 1635 to 1636, now in the
                        Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna.
                        It is a fanciful depiction of the Roman festival Veneralia
                        celebrated in honor of Venus Verticordia. The picture celebrates the
                        omnipotence of love.
                        It is based in part on a description in antiquity of a Greek
                        painting in which a cult image of Aphrodite is decorated by nymphs, with
                        winged cupids dancing around it.</p>

                    <h2>The Baptism of Christ</h2>
                    <p>Reni's Baptism of Christ, created in the mid-1620s as a
                        major masterpiece of his mature style, is based on principles of
                        composition similar to those applied in The Massacre of the Innocents.
                        The painting is built up into three clearly distinct
                        planes. At the very front, Christ bows beneath the baptismal cup, which
                        John the Baptist pours over him with his raised right hand.
                        The Baptist is standing or, rather, slightly kneeling
                        over Christ on the banks of the Jordan.</p>

                    <h2>The Assumption of the Virgin Mary</h2>
                    <p>In some versions of the assumption narrative, the
                        assumption is said to have taken place in Ephesus, in the House of the
                        Virgin Mary. This is a much more recent and localized tradition.
                        The earliest traditions say that Mary's life ended in
                        Jerusalem
        
                        (see Tomb of the Virgin Mary). By the 7th century, a variation
                        emerged, according to which one of the apostles, often identified as
                        Thomas the Apostle,
                        was not present at the death of Mary but his late arrival
                        precipitates a reopening of Mary's tomb, which is found to be empty except
                        for her grave clothes. In a later tradition, Mary drops her girdle down to
                        the apostle from
                        heaven as testament to the event. This incident is depicted in
                        many later paintings of the Assumption.</p>

                    <h2>Melancholy,Lucas Cranach the Elder</h2>
                    <p>Melancholia depicts three naked babies who, with the help of sticks, try to roll a large ball through the hoop. 
                        A winged woman, lost in thought, is slicing a cane, perhaps intending to make another hoop. She is the personification 
                     of melancholy, similar to the winged genius from the engraving of the same name by Albrecht DÃ¼rer, executed 18 years before the painting of Cranach
                        According to the ideals of the Renaissance, the whole world was based on analogies. So, melancholy at that time was associated with Saturn, a dog, carpentry.
                     Many details of the picture are a reference to these analogies: the jump of witches in a black cloud, and an army in which soldiers fall from their horses.</p>
