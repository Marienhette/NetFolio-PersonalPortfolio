            <h1 text>Medieval Period</h1>
                    <p>Medieval art evolved from the creative heritage of the Roman 
                Empire and the iconographic practices of the Early Christian church, as 
                well as the "barbarian" style of Northern Europe. The combination of these 
                elements resulted in the creation of a magnificent artistic heritage. The 
                Medieval art period had a variety of artistic trends, the most prominent of 
                which were the Early Christian art movement, the Byzantine art movement, the 
                Romanesque art movement, and the Gothic art movement.
                <br><br><br>
                    Religious symbolism and imagery were prevalent in Middle Ages paintings. Medieval 
                artists and their paintings primarily depicted religious figures and biblical 
                stories. These storylines had a hierarchy that was mostly determined by the places 
                that the paintings would fill. More major scenes in Medieval artwork would occupy 
                prominent focal points in a church or altarpiece, while less significant scenes would 
                radiate outwards.

                    <h2>Christ Pantocrator (c. 500 – 600)</h2>
                    <p>The artist is unknown, but the Christ Pantocrator, which
                    translates to "Christ the Saviour," comes from the 6th century. The
                     picture represents Christ with a raised right hand, which symbolized 
                     his gift of blessing, and a Gospel book studded with diamonds in the 
                     shape of a cross in his left arm.
                    <br><br>
                        The picture is purposefully asymmetrical to represent Christ's 
                    dualism. When glancing at the picture of Christ's face, the features on 
                    the side where Christ holds the Gospel (the right side of the artwork) are 
                    stern and rigid. It was painted with more depth and shadow, resulting in a more
                     three-dimensional, realism-inspired portrayal of Christ. This realism represented 
                     Christ's human character. In contrast, Christ's face is depicted more serenely and 
                     quietly on the side where his right hand is lifted (the left side of the picture), and
                      this represents Christ's divinity.</p>

                    <h2>Lamentation (The Mourning of Christ) (1306)</h2>
                    <p>Giotto's Lamentation (The Mourning of Christ) is part of the 
                    Scrovegni Chapel's fresco sequence depicting the Life of Christ and the 
                    Life of the Virgin. The artwork represents the scene immediately following
                    Christ's crucifixion, when his lifeless corpse was attended to by haloed
                    relatives and disciples. Mary, the focal point, caressed Christ's head as 
                    Mary Magdalene wept at His feet.
                    <br><br>
                      Giotto firmly broke away from the Byzantine style and pioneered the skills 
                    of drawing precisely from life and true to nature. It deviated from two-dimensional
                    conventions by including depth and naturalized figures. </p>

                    <h2>Maestà (c. 1308 – 1311)</h2>
                    <p>Duccio di Buoninsegna, the founder of the Sienese School of Painting, was
                     one of the finest Italian painters of the Middle Ages. The Maestà is often regarded 
                     as his masterpiece. The title Maestà meant The Virgin Mary in Majesty, and this artwork 
                     was part of a polyptych, therefore it was part of an altarpiece made up of numerous 
                     wooden panels.
                     <br><br>
                     The saints and angels in the Maestà are almost life-size.  It is vital to note 
                    the Virgin Mary's relative size; she is the largest figure in the painting. This is due 
                    to Mary's primary duty of interceding between God and humans, since she was utilized by 
                    ordinary people to get access to God. The panels in the front represent the Madonna and
                     Child enthroned, surrounded by saints and angels.</p>

                    <h2>Annunciation with St. Margaret and St. Ansanus (1333)</h2>
                    <p>Simone Martini and Lippo Memmi were Italian medieval painters who used the Gothic 
                    style in their work. The central panel of the painting represented the Annunciation, in
                    which the archangel Gabriel, with an olive branch, knelt before the seated Virgin Mary and 
                    informed her that she would soon bear God's child. Gabriel is shown with an olive branch,
                    which is a classic sign of peace. The vase between Gabriel and Mary on the floor represented
                    purity. 
                    <br><br>
                    Above it, in the central arch, was a group of angels with linked wings, where the Holy 
                    Spirit's dove had descended from heaven. The words "Hail, Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with
                     thee" were etched in gold and extended from the angel's mouth to Mary.

                    <h2>Wilton Diptych (c. 1395 – 1399)</h2>
                    <p>The panel showed the King kneeling in front of a view from heaven. England's patron 
                    saints, Edmund and Edward the Confessor, and John the Baptist, were presenting King Richard 
                    II to the Virgin Mary cradling the Christ Child, who was flanked by eleven winged angels. Richard 
                    II became King of England when he was eleven years old, hence the number eleven was significant.
                        <br>
                        The hands of the King were presented to deliver or receive Saint George's standard
                    with the crimson cross. Christ's hand was lifted to bless the standard, as was King Richard II's 
                    rule, as if the Virgin Mary and Christ Child had granted the King the divine right to rule.

                    <h2>The Trinity (c. 1411 – 1427)</h2>
                    <p>Rublev's picture depicted the angels who announced to Abraham and Sarah that they would
                    have a son. More specifically, the three angels signified the Trinity, or the unity of God the 
                    Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit. Although God is not depicted in The Trinity, the artwork
                    can still demonstrate an ideal expression of God.
                        <br>
                        As the Trinity is unified, the three figures purposefully share identical traits. The concept
                    here is that God is one, but in three people. The oneness of the Trinity was further highlighted by 
                    the blue clothes worn by each angel. The artwork shows that the three were engaged in a religious discussion
                     by gesture and glance, and they surrounded the chalice, which was symbolic.</p>

                    <h2>Presentation at the Temple (c. 1319-1348)</h2>
                    <p>Ambrogio Lorenzetti's painting depicts Mary's presentation in the temple and purification 
                    forty days after giving birth, according to Hebrew traditions. Mary, identifiable by her blue cloak
                    and scarlet attire, is holding out her son to Simeon and the prophetess Anna, both of whom recognize 
                    the Child as the Messiah. Anna is clutching a scroll that has a passage from the Gospels that describes 
                    this incident (Luke 22,38). The priest is sacrificing the presents brought by Mary and Joseph on the altar. 
                    On the far left, Joseph is portrayed alone.

                    <h2>Paradiesgärtlein: Little Garden of Paradise</h2>
                    <p>The devotional image depicts Mary reading and the newborn Jesus playing the zither in a floral 
                    garden, together with three unnamed female and as many male saints. The tree of knowledge and the four 
                    rivers of paradise, however, are missing from this iconic portrayal of the biblical Garden of Eden. Rather, 
                    the image of the "Madonna in the Rose Hag" is blended here with symbols from the secular love garden
                     (polygonal stone table with refreshments, refreshing fountain, passing the time by reading, making music, or
                    playing, cherry as erotically understood fruits).</p>
